## 🔍 Port Scanner Using Python | RISE Internship - Tamizan Skills (Cybersecurity)

This project is part of my internship at RISE under Tamizan Skills in the Cybersecurity domain. The tool is a lightweight, CLI-based port scanner built using Python.

### 🔐 Objective:
Detect open TCP ports on any IP address or domain to support basic vulnerability analysis.

### 🚀 Features:
- Scans ports 1–1024 using socket programming
- Multithreaded for high-speed scanning
- Displays list of open ports with IP resolution

### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Python
- Socket Module
- Threading Module

### ⚠️ Ethical Use:
Please use this scanner **only on authorized networks**. Unauthorized scanning may violate cybersecurity laws and network policies.
